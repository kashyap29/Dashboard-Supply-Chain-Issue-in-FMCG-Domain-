# AtliQ Mart Supply Chain Dashboard

# Problem Statement
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodra. They want   to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next 2 years.
AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend the annual contract due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.
The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘on-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’ and OnTime in full (OTIF) % of the customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

# Here are my insights I found from the dashboard:
- From the first page, we can trach Top level KPI's such as OTIF%, IF%, OT% and also LIFR%, VOFR%, Total Order Qty, Total Delivered Qty and undelivered Qty.
- We can observe that OTIF% is fat behind than Target.
- VOFR% is similar for almost 6 different products.
- AM Milk is the most demanded product & AM Ghee is the least demanded product.
- Line fill rate is more for AM Biscuit product, so we estimate that most of the customer prefer this in their orders.
- AM Milk is the most demanded and undelivered product. So we can say that Milk products don't meet the demand, We need to stock it accordingly to the demand.

# Business-related terms:
- Order lines
- Line Fill Rate
- Volume Fill Rate
- Time delivery %
- Full delivery%
- On Time In Full (OTIF) %

# Things I have learned while making this dashboard: 
- Using KPI (Key Performance Indicator) to show top-level metrics.
- Using Sparklines - tiny charts shown within cells of a table or matrix that make it easy to see and compare trends quickly. 
- Using buttons for navigation.
- Using a bookmark to capture the state of a report page and linking it to buttons.
- Text Extraction using the M Language with Power BI (extracting the last 3 lines and removing numbers from text)
  Supply Chain Domain knowledge
